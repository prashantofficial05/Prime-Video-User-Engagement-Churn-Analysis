### Prime Video User Engagement Churn Analysis

**Introduction:**

This project focuses on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of fictional customer data from Amazon Prime Video India. The objective is to understand customer engagement, identify behavioral patterns, and analyze user churn. These insights aim to support Amazon in enhancing retention strategies, optimizing the user experience, and improving subscription-based decision-making. 
  
**Goal:**

 To analyze user engagement and churn behavior for Amazon Prime Video India in order to optimize retention 
 strategies, personalize content offerings, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

**Description:**
The project uses data from a fictional Amazon Prime Video userbase to answer key business questions, including:

  - **Churn Prediction:** Identify users who are at high risk of churning.
  - **Engagement Patterns:** Analyze usage metrics such as watch time, login frequency, and subscription tenure.
  - **Plan Performance:** Compare engagement across different subscription plans (Basic, Standard, Premium).
  - **Genre Preferences:** Analyze most-watched genres to guide personalized recommendations..
  - **Tenure Analysis:** Evaluate how long users have been active subscribers.
   
**Skills:**
  - **SQL Queries:** Complex SQL queries using CTEs, Window Functions, CASE statements, Aggregations, and Joins.
  - **Python:** Data preprocessing and statistical analysis (optional but complementary).
  - **Data Visualization:** Charts and dashboards using Power BI and Seaborn/Matplotlib.
  - **Analytics:** Customer segmentation, cohort analysis, churn classification.
    
  - **Tools:**
      **SQL:** PostgreSQL for querying and reporting.
      **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for advanced analysis and visual storytelling.
      **BI Tools:** Power BI for interactive dashboards and executive reports.

**Metrics:**
  - **Churn Rate:** % of users who have not logged in during the past 30 days.
  - **Watch Time:** Average monthly hours watched by plan.
  - **Tenure:** Number of days since subscription start.
  - **Engagement Score:** Composite metric based on logins, watch time, and recency.
  - **Retention Rate:** Based on cohort behavior across monthly intervals.
    
**Key Findings:**

   - **Premium Plan** users showed the highest average watch time but had a slightly higher churn rate than 
        Standard users.
   - **Users with high activity in the first 7 days** post-subscription had a 40% higher retention rate.
   - **Drama and Thriller** are the most viewed genres across all regions.
   - **Over 30% of churned users hadnâ€™t logged in for over 45 days.
